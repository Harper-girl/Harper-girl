- 👋 Hi, I’m @Harper-girl
- 👀 I’m interested in grafx supporting: ease of use, alignment issues, pallet design suggestions, grid/rulers,
      visual cues, help bubbles, etc.,which would assist the user in their project.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to use MuseScore 3x as a student harpist with a piano background. Unfortunately, I do not 
      code, but can read some of it (depends on the language). 
- :art: I worked for the USAF in graphic arts supporting programmers and in photo editing & design for over 10 years, using PhotoShop,
      Illustrator, and propriatary USAF graphics applications.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on MuseScore functionality and logical use of graphics within the applicaion.
